4 algorithms are programmed of different types:

clustering: Kmeans
Classification/Regression: Decision Tree, Svm
Regression: Linear Regression


*Each algorithm can be trained on 3 ways:
   -Using default parametrers
   -Using parameters entered by user
   -Using autotuning to select the best combination


*To Evaluate the model we applied 2 metrics:
    -accuracy_score
    -RMSE: mean_squared_error

___we can add more metrics


*To increase the accuracy of the model we implement Feature Selector to  select the best combination of parameters(macro parameters)

*Visualisation:

Currently, we have implemented a script that can visualize the decision tree
